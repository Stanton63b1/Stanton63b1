# My Career Journey: From Army Mechanic to DevOps Engineer 

## Introduction

After proudly serving 15 years in the army, I decided to make a life changing decision to leave the military and start on a new career path and enter the rapidly developing world of IT.  This documentation serves as a record of my journey, capturing the transition from a military background to the world of cloud computing and DevOps.

## Background

In the past 6 months, I made a pivotal decision to transition away from the military and dive into the dynamic field of DevOps. This Choice did not come lightly but the want to be around and not constantly leaving my family behind to go on deployment or training exercises was ultimately what drove it. When I made the choice to leave, I was not sure what I was going to do. I started taking online courses through Coastline Community College in their Military 8-week courses for my AA in Cyber Security. During this time of me taking courses a close friend of mine mentioned a program that he ran at his company. They offered a "sponsorship" program where they set you up with 100% training materials from many of the biggest names in Certification training UDEMY, AcloudGuru and tutorial Dojo to name a few. He also informed me about an apprenticeship program that they run to develop students and career changers into cloud and DevOps engineers. After talking with him for a few weeks I knew that this was an opportunity that I could just let slide by. I immediately applied for their sponsorship program and started diving into the world of AWS Cloud. (Update Feb 2024- The apprenticeship program that I was planning on applying for got canceled during the layoffs that happened in Jan)

## Certification Journey

### AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification
I started studying for the AWS CCP exam about 1 month before I took my exam. I used a mix of courses from UDEMY, ACG and used the practice test that are offered from Tutorials Dojo. If I could go back, I would refrain from using practice exams until I had completed the courses. I say this because I noticed that I started focusing on the questions more than the material and I guess you could say I was more memorizing the questions at first opposed to learning the content. I decided to take my exam at a test location as it was my first certification and I just felt like this would be the easiest way to take it. I took my exam in Dec 2023 and passed. 


### AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification
After passing my AWS CCP I took a few weeks to spend with the family during the holiday time. My wife also had a knee surgery that i took some time to help her recover from and get back on her feet. I started studying using Adrian Cantrill's SAA course in Feb 2024.

## Study Plan

I am not someone who gets excited about studying, I would much rather learn from hands on experience. With that being said I try to ingest as much information as I can. I also make sure that if something I am learning isn’t clicking with me that I ask questions or repeat test or ask someone with more knowledge to figure it out. 

## Exam Preparation

#### CCP 
In preparation I used practice exams from TD and I tried not to overdo it. Coming into the exam, I did not do any practice exams the day of my certification, I thought if I tried to push through practice test, I may overwhelm or stress myself out.

## Exam Day

#### CCP 
The day of the exam I had the pretest worries as I always have. I’ve never been a good "tester" or at least I’ve never really liked taking tests. Taking the exam at a test location made the process super easy. I just showed up at the test location WAY too early to make sure I did not miss it. The Proctor for the location I tested at in Riverview Florida was very helpful and got me set up and testing with immediately there was no sitting around waiting. 

## Results

After the exam, I found out that I passed as soon as I had submitted. This was a giant relief and what I consider my first small step into the world of AWS Cloud. 

## Future Steps

Going forward I plan to study for the SAA certification along with working on some projects to help build my knowledge and start building a portfolio. 

## Conclusion

So far, this journey has been fun, I have a lot of friends that work in the field and daily I’ve heard them talking about things that I just didn’t understand. Now that I’ve been learning about the cloud and AWS, I can finally grasp what these services that they are always talking about really are.
